# QTaste Multiple Instances Component test: Check use of undefined component.

# This test case has the goal to verify that scripts which get instances of a Multiple Instances Component not defined in the Testbed configuration will be reported as "Not Available".
# @preparation Prepare a testbed configuration file without any MultipleInstancesTest with id=3

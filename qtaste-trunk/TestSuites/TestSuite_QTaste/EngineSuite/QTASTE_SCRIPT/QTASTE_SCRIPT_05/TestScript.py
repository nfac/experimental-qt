# QTaste scripting language test: Check doSteps function.

# The goal of this test case is to verify that the doSteps function works as expected.
#
# @preparation Define the following steps functions and table:
# <pre>
# def step1():
#   logger.trace('-- step 1 --')
#
# def step1a():
#   logger.trace('-- step 1a --')
#
# def step2():
#   logger.trace('-- step 2 --')
#
# def step3():
#   logger.trace('-- step 3 --')
#
# def step4():
#   logger.trace('-- step 4 --')
#
# def step5():
#   logger.trace('-- step 5 --')
#
# steps = [ (1, step1),
#          ('1a', step1a),
#          (2, step2),
#          (3, step3),
#          (4, step4),
#          (5, step5)
#        ]
# </pre>
# call doSteps with the steps table and the selector from the test data (None if empty)
#
# @data SELECTOR [String] Steps selector to be used by the doSteps function, may be empty to use no selector

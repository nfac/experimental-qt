# QTaste scripting language test: Check unpersistence of variables.
# <p>
# The goal of this test case is to verify that variables defined in the execution of a test script are not kept upon execution of further scripts.
# <p>
# In a first run (row 1 of CSV file), the test will set a variable to some value, in a second run (row 2 of CSV file), the test will check that the variable is not defined.
# @preparation None

# QTaste scripting language test: Check verbs return values.
# <p>
# The goal of this test case is to verify that values returned by verbs called in a test script are correctly passed to the script.
# <p>
# The test will call verbs returning string, integer, double and boolean values respectively and check that the returned values are the expected ones
# @preparation None
